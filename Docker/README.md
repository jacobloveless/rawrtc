# RAWRTC Build Environment for Docker 

This folder contains a functioning environment to run the RAWRTC build process
inside a new Linux based docker instance.

## Notes
Currently the base `Dockerfile` has a functional RAWRTC build process on the
latest Ubuntu release. Additional Dockerfiles (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier)
can be used by simply changing the base image in Line 1 of the file 
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

To something like
```
FROM ubuntu:14.04
```
This is especially useful for generating static binaries where you need to
ensure compatibility with older Glibc installations.
***

## Docker Example

The first step is to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/
installation/linux/ubuntu/)

Once Docker is installed and available, running the base is simple:

```
bash
git clone -b dev_docker https://github.com/jacobloveless/rawrtc
cd rawrtc/docker

# build the docker image, and tag (t) it with a name
# docker build <imagefile> -t <tag name>
docker build Dockerfile -t rawrtc

# run a version of the newly build image and get a shell
# we are going to run docker interactively (i) with pseudo tty (t) (for terminal access)
docker run -it rawrtc bash
``` 

You should now be in a shell of the build environment
```
docker run -it rawrtc bash
